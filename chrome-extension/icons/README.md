# Extension Icons

You need to add three icon files to this directory:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels

You can create these icons using any image editor or online icon generator.

**Quick way to create icons:**

1. Go to https://www.favicon-generator.org/
2. Upload any image or create a simple icon
3. Download the icons in the required sizes
4. Rename them to match the filenames above
5. Place them in this directory

**Or use this simple placeholder:**

For now, you can use any PNG image and resize it to the required dimensions using an online tool like https://www.resizepixel.com/

The icons should represent a history or clock symbol for best UX.
